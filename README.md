Flex cable with DB-50 socket and Omnetics nano-d A28500-051 plug. Stack-up: video signals + some clock lines, ground, most clock signals, biases + ground plane. The longer version of the cable has all the serial clocks untied for greater flexibility (though the first generation of MAS CCDs only require a single set of serial clocks for the MAS readout) and thicker bias line tracks. Stiffener is outlined in the F.Paste layer. DB-50 connector side needs to be cut as close as possible to the edge to accommodate tight space constraints inside the dewar. Dimensions: 280.3 mm x 16.64 mm. Longer version 422.4 mm x 16.71 mm.
